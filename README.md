# GlamouRNG Picker

A web application for FFXIV players to create random glamour sets from items on the Marketboard.

###### Created using Next.js, with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS

## 🤔 Why I built this

I love all the fashion options there are in FFXIV but sometimes there are too many and I can't decide what looks good together. After having a friend in my Free Company choose numbers to create my outfit for their in-game wedding, I thought it would be a fun idea to create an application for other users to make a glamour set this way!

## 🔗 Live Demo

Try the application live here: https://glamourngpicker.vercel.app/

## 📖 Features

- Users can input numbers for head, body, hand, leg, and foot pieces
- Users can input numbers for dyes for each piece
- Users can submit form to receive randomize glamour based on their input
- Users can choose to randomize glamour without inputting numbers
- Users can reroll the glamour on the presented glamour window
